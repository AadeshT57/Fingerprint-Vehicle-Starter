# Hello there! If you are looking for a project which is related to safety and security of vehicles, then you are on the right page.
# This project contains following:
   # Project code
   # Project images
# This project work focuses on the use of fingerprints for vehicle starting, as opposed to the conventional method of using keys. The developed prototype of this project serve as an impetus to drive future research, geared towards developing a more robust and real-time fingerprint vehicle starter systems. The present scenario of accessing vehicles, locks, systems that require security is getting obsolete as time is passing by, technology advances, and new trends emerge. Therefore, as things get obsolete the world calls for a better solution that is better than the present and can solve the problems for creating a better future.
